# üè• Healthcare API

### ‚ùïAPI and Desktop Client for a Healthcare System data manager implemented in .NET 8.0


## ‚û°Ô∏è Local Setup 
- Clone this repository to your machine
- In MS Visual Studio:
    - Navigate to the solution's folder and open the project
    - Compile and run the application
- Via CLI environment:
    - Navigate to the solution's folder
    - Execute the command `dotnet run`


## ‚û°Ô∏è API
- The API backend uses DTOs to transfer data from the user's request to the database
- The password received via DTO is hashed with salt using the `Argon2id` algorithm before being stored in the database
- If the user tries to access an endpoint using an invalid or expired JWT token, a `401 Unauthorized` will be returned
- The API endpoint can be consumed by connecting to the concatenation of the base URL with the specific API path shown in the following sections for each endpoint

The following accordions contain the model schemas and the API endpoints:
